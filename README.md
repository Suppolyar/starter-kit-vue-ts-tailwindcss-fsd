# Starter-Kit: Feature Sliced Design (FSD) + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite + TailwindCSS + Eslint + Prettier
Hello! This is an enhanced template project incorporating the Feature Sliced Design (FSD) architecture, providing a ready-made configuration for rapid development with a structured and maintainable codebase. Just clone the project and start coding with an advanced architecture in place ðŸ˜‡

## About this Enhanced Starter-Kit
This Starter-Kit includes all the features of the original template (Vite, Vue 3, Pinia, Vue Router, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and Prettier) and extends it with the Feature Sliced Design architecture. FSD is a methodology for frontend projects, which aims to divide the application according to business logic and scopes of responsibility.

- Feature Sliced Design: A methodology for structuring projects in a way that allows for scalability, maintainability, and ease of understanding. It helps in organizing codebase around features and business processes.

### Enhanced Project Structure with FSD

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features/         # Feature folders (each feature encapsulates its own logic and UI)
